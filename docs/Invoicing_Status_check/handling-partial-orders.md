# Handling Partial Orders

### Partial Shipment Check

Before invoicing, **refresh the order** to determine if it has been shipped in full or if a partial shipment has occurred. 

- If the **“Ship Partial”** box is checked in the **Additional Info** tab:
  - The **Customer Service Representative (CSR)** is already aware.
  - The **customer has been contacted** and approved the partial shipment.

---

> **Important Note:**  
> Always ensure that the **customer’s approval** for partial shipments is confirmed before proceeding with invoicing.
